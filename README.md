# ðŸ‘€ Peekaboo

Peekaboo was a project that I was inspired to make after using Nmap via Kali Linux. This project uses Nmap, socket, and asyncio in order to create a port scanner that is simple to use and efficient.

### Peekaboo is able to:
- Recognize open ports
- Recognize timeout errors
- Recognize refused connections
- Recognize OSErrors
- Deliver a scan report using Nmap with service fingerprinting
